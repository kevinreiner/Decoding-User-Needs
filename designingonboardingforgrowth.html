          <h2>#summary</h2>
          <p>Moving toward a more product-led growth strategy at fraud0 means rethinking how users first interact with the product – removing friction, adding clarity, and letting the experience speak for itself. But PostHog data revealed a gap between intention and reality: fewer than 1% of website visitors made it through the onboarding flow. The sharpest drop-offs happened right at the start, with 90% abandoning after clicking the conversion hook, and again during onboarding, where up to 73% didn’t make it to the end. Improving this flow became a key step in aligning with a PLG approach. By focusing on UX, the onboarding experience was redesigned to be simpler, faster, and more intuitive – making it easier for users to reach value without hand-holding, and bringing the product closer to the front of the growth strategy.</p>

        <h2>01 Discover</h2>
        <p>The initial phase involved an extensive content audit to identify all existing topics within the Knowledge Center. To benchmark industry standards, we analyzed competitors' knowledge centers and identified three potential structuring frameworks: (1) Topic-based (organized by key subjects), (2) Role-based (tailored to different user groups), (3) Task-based (focused on specific actions users perform). Additionally, we conducted user research to understand target audiences, their needs, and motivations for using the Knowledge Center. These insights provided a foundation for the subsequent restructuring efforts.</p>

        <h2>02 Define</h2>
        <p>After synthesizing our research findings, we identified the primary usability issues and determined the best structural approach. The decision was made to adopt a topic-based framework, aligning with users' expectations and ensuring a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. This approach enabled better discoverability of key resources and streamlined navigation.</p>

        <h2>03 Develop</h2>
        <p>To build a robust information architecture, we conducted a card sorting experiment, allowing us to gain insights into how users naturally categorize information. The results guided the creation of a new sitemap, designed with the following principles: Flexibility: The structure accommodates future topics and content expansion. Consistency: Uniform categorization enhances user comprehension. User-centricity: Navigation aligns with users' mental models, improving accessibility.</p>

        <h2>04 Deliver</h2>
        <p>In the final phase, all content pages were developed and organized within a dedicated space in Confluence, following the new sitemap. Company-wide feedback was collected and incorporated, ensuring that the structure met both user needs and business goals. The redesigned Knowledge Center was then successfully deployed via Scroll Viewport, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.</p>

        <p>The redesign made it easier for users to find information, reducing support queries and improving engagement with key resources. Navigation became more intuitive, and the topic-based structure helped users get answers faster without relying on a bloated FAQ. Internal teams could update content more efficiently, keeping the Knowledge Center scalable and organized. Overall, it shifted from a cluttered, hard-to-navigate repository to a practical, user-friendly resource that better supports advertisers in tackling ad fraud.</p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <h2>#1 A Topic-Based Structure Wasn’t the Obvious Choice—User Research Made It Clear</h2>

        <p>At first, a role-based or task-based structure seemed logical, especially since advertisers have different levels of expertise. However, our user research showed that users weren’t thinking in terms of roles—they were searching for answers based on problems. This insight led to the topic-based structure, which provided more intuitive navigation.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>#2 The FAQ Wasn’t Just Overloaded—It Was a Symptom of Poor Information Flows</h2>
        <p>One surprising takeaway was that the bloated FAQ section wasn’t just due to too many questions—it was because users had nowhere else to find contextual explanations. This led us to deconstruct the FAQ and integrate answers into relevant topic pages, drastically reducing the reliance on a catch-all section.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>#3 Implementing the New Structure Required More Than Just Content Migration</h2>
        <p>Translating the new architecture into Confluence and Scroll Viewport wasn’t a simple content transfer. The new structure required reworking metadata, search functionality, and cross-linking between pages to truly reflect the improved user journey. Without these technical refinements, the redesign would have been just a surface-level fix.</p>
